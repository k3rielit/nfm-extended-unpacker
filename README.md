## Build

1. Have .NET 8.0 LTS SDK installed.
2. Build the solution.
3. You should get a RadqExtractor binary.

## Usage

1. Drag and drop one or multiple .radq files onto the executable (or pass absolute paths to .radq files as command line arguments).
2. All files will be turned back into a regular archive, and put next to the original file with a .zip extension.
